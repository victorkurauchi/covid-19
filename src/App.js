      <p>So this is just like the flu, right?</p>
      <p>
        Not quite. People have been quoting how many deaths per year there are
        for the flu (
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html#:~:text=">
          12,000 to 61,000
        </a>
        ) to the deaths so far with coronavirus (
        <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-maps-and-cases/">
          ~50
        </a>
        ) in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get the full story you usually have to look at more than static
        numbers. In this case, we need to look at:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fatality Rate</li>
        <li>Infection Growth Rate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The flu has a general fatality rate of 0.1%
        <br />
        COVID-19's fatality rate right now is 3.4%

        What really sucks about this virus vs. the flu is that you can carry it
        around with you for weeks infecting people before you even know you have
        it. There is no way to know until it's too late. That's why containment
        is so important.

        You just saw that logarithmic growth is a powerful thing. The
        coronavirus is following a nearly perfect logarithmic curve in the
        US--even with our low levels of testing. While network marketers hope to
        use it in their favor to gain financial independence, a virus doesn't
        have to be convinced to keep the downline going.
